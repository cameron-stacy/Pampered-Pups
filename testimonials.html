             <section class="testF"><br>Dear Pamperd Pups<br>I was nervous about boarding Mister Wilson at Pampered Pups. He is very reserved and particular about his surroundings> However, Iwas relieved at how attentive Carmella was with him. Mister Wilson let his guard down and soon began to act like a "Pampered pup". Yor company slogan really says it all.<br><i>Sandra S.</i> </section>
