   <section class="aboutB"> <h3>Where your dog waggles more and barks less!</h3> Ever since I was a kid,dogs have been some of my best friends. I grew up helping my Aunt Maria in her dog gromming ssalon, The Clip-n-Fluff. It was only natural that this love for pets would develop into my life's work. After college, I managed a local veterinary clinic for six years, until 2003, when my aunt was getting ready to retire and wanted me to take over her business. I saw the need for a place where dogs of every breed and size could play and get some TLC while their families were at work or out of town. And so,that year Pamperd Pups was born. we've been pampering dogs ever since,and they haven't stopped wagging their tails!<br>Pampered Pups is just as popular with owners as it is with their pet. Our services and hours are tailored to meet the needs of busy pet owners who want their "best friends" treated with the affection and care they get at home. Come see for yourself.Stop in for a visit,and bring your dog along with you.<br><b>Dee Ramos</b><br>Owner/Operator<br>Pampered Pups  </section>
